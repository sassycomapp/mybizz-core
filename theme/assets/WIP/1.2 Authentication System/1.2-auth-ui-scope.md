That was a good response# Mybizz 1.2 UI Specifications

## Research Sources (ONLY specified folders)
- `theme/assets/Mybizz_Methods/03_dev_plan.md` (Primary: Phase 1.2 Authentication System)
- `theme/assets/Mybizz_Methods/10_ref_security_compliance.md` (Section 1.2 Authentication & Access Control - functional requirements impacting UI)
- `theme/assets/Mybizz_Methods/07_user-flows.md` (User flows referencing auth/signup/login)
- General M3 UI standards from `03_dev_plan.md`

**Note:** No files found in `Anvil_Methods/*` containing &quot;1.2 Authentication&quot; references. No code generated - pure extraction of design specs, components, layouts, styling.

## Design System: Material Design 3 (M3)
**Mandatory for all 1.2 Auth UI:**
- Theme: M3 Theme (Anvil dependency ID: 4UK6WHQ6UX7AKELK)
- Typography roles: headline-large (titles), body-medium (labels/text)
- Color roles: theme:Primary (primary actions), theme:On Primary, theme:Surface, theme:Error (validation)
- Button hierarchy: filled (primary), outlined (secondary), text (tertiary)
- Inputs: ALWAYS outlined role
- Containers: Card (outlined for forms), ColumnPanel/LinearPanel for layout
- Error handling: outlined-error role on inputs

**Essential Components for Auth Forms:**
- Card (outlined) - Form container
- Heading - Titles (headline-large)
- TextBox (outlined) - Email, password, business name
- Checkbox - Remember me, Terms agreement
- Button (filled) - Sign In/Create Account/Send Reset Link
- Link - Forgot password?, Already have an account?

## Layouts
- **BlankLayout** (no navigation drawer) - Used for all auth screens (Login, Signup, Password Reset)
  - Centered Card container
  - No NavigationDrawerLayout (public/unprotected screens)

## Forms & Components

### 1. LoginForm
**Purpose:** User authentication
**Layout:** BlankLayout
**Components & Styling:**
- Card (outlined) - Main form container
- Heading (headline-large): &quot;Sign In&quot;
- TextBox (outlined): Email input
- TextBox (outlined, password=True): Password input
- Checkbox: &quot;Remember me&quot;
- Button (filled): &quot;Sign In&quot; (primary action)
- Link: &quot;Forgot password?&quot; (text-button style)
- Error states: outlined-error role on inputs, theme:Error colors

### 2. SignupForm
**Purpose:** New account creation (business signup)
**Layout:** BlankLayout
**Components & Styling:**
- Card (outlined) - Main form container
- Heading (headline-large): &quot;Create Account&quot;
- TextBox (outlined): Email
- TextBox (outlined, password=True): Password
- TextBox (outlined, password=True): Confirm password
- TextBox (outlined): Business name
- Checkbox: &quot;I agree to Terms&quot;
- Button (filled): &quot;Create Account&quot;
- Link: &quot;Already have an account?&quot; (links to LoginForm)
- Error states: outlined-error on invalid fields (password mismatch, weak password)

### 3. PasswordResetForm
**Purpose:** Password recovery
**Layout:** BlankLayout
**Components & Styling:**
- Card (outlined) - Main form container
- Heading (headline-small): &quot;Reset Password&quot;
- TextBox (outlined): Email input
- Button (filled): &quot;Send Reset Link&quot;
- Error states: outlined-error for invalid email

## Functional UI Requirements (from Security Specs)
**Password Policies (UI Validation):**
- Length: 8+ characters
- Complexity: 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number
- Real-time validation feedback (error states on TextBox)
- Cannot reuse last 3 passwords (server-side, UI confirmation)

**Session Management UI:**
- Inactivity timeout: 30 minutes → Prompt: &quot;Session expired due to inactivity&quot; → Redirect to LoginForm
- Absolute timeout: 8 hours

**MFA (Future/Optional):**
- Google Authenticator support (UI toggle in settings, not 1.2 core)

## User Flows Involving Auth (Extracted)
- **Onboarding:** Signup → Business info → Welcome email with login details → Prompt re-login on expiry
- **Session Timeout:** &quot;Your session has expired. Don&#39;t worry - your cart has been saved!&quot; → Re-login
- **Cancellation:** Email link (no login required for some actions)
- **Startup Logic:** Not logged in → LoginForm; Logged in → DashboardForm (AdminLayout/CustomerLayout)

## Navigation Integration
- Post-auth: Route to DashboardForm using AdminLayout (NavigationDrawerLayout with M3 NavigationLink items)
- Customer portal: CustomerLayout variant

**All specs adhere to M3 compliance: outlined inputs, filled primary buttons, theme colors, no legacy components (no Tabs, no Pivot).**
