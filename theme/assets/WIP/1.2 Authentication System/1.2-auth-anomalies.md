# New Rules to add
1.every file created must have the current date stamp as the first line of the file. following this format exactly with the hash in front to display the date stamp as a commented out line. The parentheses shown in the example are not a part of the example and must be omitted:
(# CREATED at: YYYYMMDD-HHMM)
In the case where the file does not have a "created at" date the "created at" date must be inserted. In this case, the current date should be used as the created at date
2. every file that gets updated must have the current date stamp as the second line of the file. following this format exactly with the hash in front to display the date stamp as a commented out line. The parentheses shown in the example are not a part of the example and must be omitted:
(# UPDATED at: YYYYMMDD-HHMM)
3. Every file that gets worked on must have "# STATUS" status as the 3rd line. following this format exactly with the hash in front to display the line as a commented out line. The parentheses shown in the example are not a part of the example and must be omitted:
