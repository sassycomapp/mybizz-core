## Startup Module, Form
Anvil App Startup Model
- Anvil no longer uses a dedicated Startup Module
- Anvil starts by instantiating a Startup Form, not modules
- The Startup Form (e.g. HomePage) is defined in app settings
- Startup logic is typically placed in the Startup Form and should be designed to run once
- Client-side modules do not self-execute; they only run when explicitly imported and called

    user = anvil.users.get_user()

      if user['role'] in ['owner', 'manager', 'admin', 'staff']:
        open_form('dashboard.DashboardForm')
