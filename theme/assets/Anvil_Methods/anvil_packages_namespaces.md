About Anvil **packages** - This *is* the recommended way to structure anything beyond a trivial app.

I’ll break this down clearly and tie it back to familiar concepts like folders, tiers, and good architecture.

---

## 1. What an Anvil “package” really is

Your analogy is correct:

> **A package in Anvil is essentially a folder + Python namespace.**

More precisely:

* A **package** is a container for:

  * Client Forms
  * Client Modules
  * Server Modules (if it’s a server package)
* It also creates a **Python import namespace**, just like a folder with `__init__.py` in normal Python.

So if you have:

```
client/
  users/
    UserForm
    user_logic.py
```

You can import like:

```python
from .users import user_logic
```

or

```python
from ..users.user_logic import some_function
```

This is *real Python packaging*, not just visual grouping.

---

## 2. Client Packages vs Server Packages

### Client Packages

* Contain:

  * Forms (UI)
  * Client-side modules
* Run in the **browser**
* Can:

  * Handle UI logic
  * Validate input
  * Call server functions
* Cannot:

  * Access Data Tables directly
  * Access secrets
  * Do privileged work

### Server Packages

* Contain **server modules only**
* Run on Anvil’s Python server
* Can:

  * Access Data Tables
  * Use secrets
  * Enforce security rules
  * Perform business logic

Think of this as a **hard security boundary**, not just organization.

---

## 3. Forms vs Modules inside packages

Inside a package you’ll typically see:

### Forms

* Visual UI components
* Event handlers (`button_click`, etc.)
* Minimal logic

### Modules

* Reusable logic
* Helper functions
* Non-visual code

**Rule of thumb:**

> If it doesn’t need a UI, it probably shouldn’t be in a Form.

---

## 4. Is a 2-tier or 3-tier scaffold possible?

Yes—and it’s not only possible, it’s **the best practice**.

### Typical Recommended Architecture (3-tier)

#### 1️⃣ Presentation Layer (Client)

**Client Packages**

```
client/
  users/
    UserListForm
    UserEditForm
  orders/
    OrderForm
```

Responsibilities:

* UI rendering
* Collecting user input
* Calling server functions
* Displaying results

---

#### 2️⃣ Application / Business Logic Layer (Server)

**Server Packages**

```
server/
  users/
    service.py
  orders/
    service.py
```

Responsibilities:

* Business rules
* Validation
* Permissions
* Orchestration

Example:

```python
@anvil.server.callable
def create_user(data):
    validate_user_data(data)
    return users_repo.insert(data)
```

---

#### 3️⃣ Data Access Layer (Server)

Often inside the same server package, but logically separate:

```
server/
  users/
    repository.py
```

Responsibilities:

* Data Tables access
* Queries
* Persistence logic

Example:

```python
def insert(data):
    app_tables.users.add_row(**data)
```

---

## 5. How packages help you scale

Packages give you:

✅ Logical grouping
✅ Clean imports
✅ Easier refactoring
✅ Team collaboration
✅ Enforced separation of concerns

Without packages, large Anvil apps quickly turn into:

* Huge Forms
* Circular imports
* Copy-pasted logic
* Security mistakes

---

## 6. Common, recommended package patterns

### Feature-based (most common & recommended)

```
client/
  users/
  orders/
  auth/

server/
  users/
  orders/
  auth/
```

This scales very well.

---

### Layer-based (less common in Anvil)

```
client/
  forms/
  utils/

server/
  services/
  repositories/
```

This can work, but feature-based is usually clearer in Anvil apps.

---

## 7. What *not* to do

❌ Put database access in client code
❌ Put heavy business logic in Forms
❌ Create one giant “utils” module
❌ Ignore packages until the app is big

Packages are cheap—use them early.

---

## 8. Final answers to your direct questions

> **Is a package like a folder?**
> ✅ Yes, plus Python namespacing.

> **Can I create a 2- or 3-tier scaffold using packages?**
> ✅ Yes, absolutely.

> **Is this the recommended method?**
> ✅ **Yes. This is the recommended, professional way to build Anvil apps.**

If you want, next I can:

* Show a **complete example scaffold** (client + server packages)
* Show **import patterns that won’t bite you later**
* Review a structure you’re considering and refine it

Just tell me how deep you want to go.
